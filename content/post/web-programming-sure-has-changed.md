So I finally started a blog. I always said I wouldn't, but here we are. I'm not entirely sure what changed, other than the fact that I recently purchased a few domain names, including this site, and was looking for ways to utilize them.

Recently I've been really into web development, in particular learning some of the modern techniques that didn't exist when I had last done web programming (circa 2000). Back then I had been using the traditional LAMP stack, using traditional "inline" PHP inside HTML. It's crazy how much has changed since then.

It all started when I decided to develop an [online recipe book](https://recipebook.wineandcats.com)<sup>1</sup> for my wife. She had been trying a few things recently, including Evernote and Google Drive, but nothing seemed to meet her needs. This turned out to be a great opportunity to work towards one of my goals for 2016 which was to learn a new programming language. After some research, I discovered (or rather rediscovered) [GO](https://golang.org) and the great development community it has, especially around web application development.

To make a long story short, I've spent the past few months immersed in the web and all it has to offer. It's been a great experience, both enjoyable and extremely educational, and it's made me a more well-rounded developer. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me and continue to learn how little I still know.
